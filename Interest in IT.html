    <h1> Interest in IT</h1>
    <h2> What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</h2>
        <p>
            My understanding of IT is anything that involves electricity or enables human beings to do things a lot easily. 
            Although I am interested in anything IT related in general, I do have one specific area that I am curious about 
            and would like to explore more. My interest in this area started when I found out that my internet speed was very 
            slow compared to one of my friends back in 2019.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
    <h2> Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h2>
        
        <p>I began researching the cause of my slow internet speed, eventually finding out that it was the internet plan my parents
            selected. I searched on my internet provider’s website and discovered that they were advertising a better speed but for 
            the same price that my parents were paying. I convinced them that this plan was way better and we changed plans after that. 
            Two years later, our internet speed dropped again, for some unknown reason. 
            I began researching different internet providers and their plans. I eventually chose to go with Optus because they gave us 
            Optus Sport for free if we were contracted with them.

    <h2>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h2>
        
        <p>Initially, I did not know about the different university options I had. 
            I thought that every university came with the same courses, taught the same stuff and had the same amount of culture. 
            But I found out that every university is different and some have courses that others don’t. 
            My initial course was the Bachelor of Computer Science in Semester 1 2022, but I thought that it was too difficult for a 
            beginner programmer like me to keep up with as well as understand the concepts. In year 12, I chose RMIT simply because, 
            in my opinion, the top two universities, The University of Melbourne and Monash University, either did not have the course 
            that I originally was enrolled in or was too far from where I live. 
            After dropping the Bachelor of Computer Science, I chose to enrol into the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT 
            because it was the university that I was already at, and I wanted to explore the different aspects of IT rather than 
            just one, being programming.
        </p>

    <h2> What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h2>
            
            <p>I expect to learn what aspect or area of IT I am really interested in as I do not know what I want to be in the future nor do 
                I have a career that I want to pursue. I want to have a deeper understanding of not only the world of IT but also what sort of 
                careers there are involving IT. While I do not believe this subject will give me an in-depth understanding of the areas of IT, 
                I believe that it can help me to reflect and ask myself what I really want to do.

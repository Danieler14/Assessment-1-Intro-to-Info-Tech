        <h2>A description (in your own words) of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you.</h2>
            <p>
                This position involves creating and designing the Professional People’s product page. 
                This position is appealing to me because of the high salary and the location being very close to home. 
                I also am attracted to the full-time position as I want a job where I am guaranteed shifts, annual leave and sick leave. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>

            <h2>A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.</h2>
                <p>
                    The qualifications required are a Bachelor’s degree. Although it does not state which Bachelor's degree, I assume it means a degree related to the field of IT.
                    Professional People Pty Ltd also needs an employee with substantial experience not only in HTML5, CSS and JavaScript, but also a similar role using both 
                    or either Angular JavaScript or React Javascript. The company wants a person who is presented well and is able to document and communicate effectively.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>

            <h2>A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have.</h2>
                <p>
                    I currently do not have any qualifications, but I am working towards completing the Bachelor of Information Technology. 
                    Although I do not have immense experience in HTML5, CSS and JavaScript, I do have a basic understanding of the three languages and will work towards 
                    widening my knowledge of them. I also am able to both present myself and document well. 
                    Even though I am not able to communicate well, I aim to practise with people that I do not know so that I can acquire the required skill.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>

            <h2>A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building on those you have now.</h2>
                <p>
                    To obtain the qualification, I first need to satisfactorily pass this subject and my other subjects in this semester. 
                    Then I will need to pass the first year, then second year, then third year to acquire it. By creating a website in this assignment, 
                    I will be able to broaden my knowledge in HTML5 and CSS. I desire to start learning JavaScript soon, during the semester break. 
                    I want to continue how I have been presenting myself as well as how I document. Through practice with peers and friends, I hope to be able to communicate well, 
                    not just for my career, but for my life as well as it is a skill that is utilised in everyday life.

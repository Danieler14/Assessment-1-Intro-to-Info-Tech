       <h2>Overview</h2>
       <p>My project will be creating a discord bot called UO bot (pronounced “you-o bot”) that allows competitive pokemon players,
        such as myself, to know what the recommended sets are for a certain pokemon. When the individual types in a pokemon,
        this bot would not only spit out the recommended moves for the pokemon, but also its recommended nature, EV/IV spread, abilities and stats.
        This allows all pokemon players, new or experienced, to be able to understand which moves are better than others and why they should run them in this way.
        My discord bot would be a great help to all pokemon based discord servers.</p>
       <br>

       <h2>Motivation</h2>
       <p>There are more than 10,000 players that use Pokemon Showdown, an online battle simulator that does not require a Pokemon cartridge.
        As some new players do not know how to run a pokemon, (i.e. not knowing what moves/abilities/EVs/iVs etc. to put on the pokemon),
        a discord bot would be an extremely useful resource. As a competitive pokemon player myself,
        I would love to be able to teach new players about the benefits of running a specific move or ability.
        The bot would also teach experienced players how to run a pokemon as the metagame usually only consists of a number of “good” pokemon.
        If an experienced player wants to use an underused pokemon, they may not know the recommended set,
        meaning that the bot would also be really convenient for them to use.</p>
       <br>

       <h2>Description</h2>

       <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
       <p>I will need to have a discord account, which I already have done, so that I can create my discord bot and test if it works once I have completed it.
        I will also need to use a website called Autocode which allows me to build the discord bot and host it on my own server before making it public.
        I would also need a text-editing application such as Notepad++.
        I already have VS Code installed onto my devices so I am not required to install another.
        I will also have to use the internet as I do not know how to build it on my own.</p>
       <br>

       <h2>Skills Required</h2>
       <p>I would have to be able to program the bot to receive an input.
        By doing so, the bot is able to read this input and then spit out an output.
        I would also have to have the skill of giving the recommended sets for each of the pokemon.
        Within this, requires the understanding of different pokemon’s stats, move learnset, abilities, optimal EVs/IVs etc.
        I also need to have evidence to back up my recommended sets such as countering other pokemon, optimal teams/team cores.</p>
       <br>

       <h2>Outcome</h2>
       <p>If this project is successful, the outcome would be that I would ask for permission from different discord servers to host my bot.
        By doing so, I share my knowledge of competitive pokemon and how each pokemon interacts with the metagame.
        This solves the problem of new players not having expertise in battling, by giving them a resource to draw upon when they battle.
        This bot also encourages new and existing players to expand their knowledge on playing competitive pokemon and possibly even motivate players
        to compete in real life tournaments such as the Regional Championships or the International Championships.</p>

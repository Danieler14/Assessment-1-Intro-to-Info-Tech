       <h2>Overview</h2>
       <p>My project will be creating a discord bot called UO bot (pronounced “you-o bot”) that allows competitive pokemon players,
        such as myself, to know what the recommended sets are for a certain pokemon. When the individual types in a pokemon,
        this bot would not only spit out the recommended moves for the pokemon, but also its recommended nature, EV/IV spread, abilities and stats.
        This allows all pokemon players, new or experienced, to be able to understand which moves are better than others and why they should run them in this way.
        My discord bot would be a great help to all pokemon based discord servers.</p>
       <br>

       <h2>Motivation</h2>
       <p>There are more than 10,000 players that use Pokemon Showdown, an online battle simulator that does not require a Pokemon cartridge.
        As some new players do not know how to run a pokemon, (i.e. not knowing what moves/abilities/EVs/iVs etc. to put on the pokemon),
        a discord bot would be an extremely useful resource. As a competitive pokemon player myself,
        I would love to be able to teach new players about the benefits of running a specific move or ability.
        The bot would also teach experienced players how to run a pokemon as the metagame usually only consists of a number of “good” pokemon.
        If an experienced player wants to use an underused pokemon, they may not know the recommended set,
        meaning that the bot would also be really convenient for them to use.</p>

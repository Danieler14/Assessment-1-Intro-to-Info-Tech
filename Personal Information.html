            Hi! My name is Daniel Dinh and I am a student studying the Bachelor of Information Technology at the 
            Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT).
            My  student number is s3944753 and my email is s3944753@student.rmit.edu.au. My nationality is Vietnamese 
            but I was born here as my parents immigrated from Vietnam to Melbourne, Australia.
            I am able to speak fluent English, broken Vietnamese, a tiny bit of Italian (learnt from high school) and
            know some Japanese words (from anime).
            I graduated high school only just last year and spent around two and a half years of my VCE experience learning from home.
            One fact about me is that I won $500 from playing in a Pokemon Tournament in 2019.
